You are an expert language annotator and evaluator of gender-neutral translation for English-Greek. Your task is to extract target Greek phrases that refer to human beings, determine whether each phrase is masculine, feminine, or neutral, and assess if the gender expressed in each phrase is correct with respect to the source. Based on the phrases, determine whether the sentence was translated in a correctly gendered, wrongly gendered, or neutral way.

Guidelines:
1. Identify relevant phrases: carefully read the Greek sentence and extract all phrases that refer to human beings or groups of human beings, including:
* Noun phrases (e.g., "μία άριστη ομιλήτρια", "η πολιτεία", “ένας πρόεδρος”),
* Adjective phrases (e.g., "εξαιρετικά κουρασμένος", "το παντρεμένο", “ικανοποιημένη”).

2. Evaluate gender information: consider only the social gender conveyed by the phrases, not grammatical gender, and assign a label to each phrase [M/F/N]. For example:
* Phrases like "ο ομιλητής", "είναι πολύ χαρούμενος", "όλοι οι συνάδελφοι", and "οι εργαζόμενοι" are masculine [M];
* Phrases like "η ομιλήτρια", "είναι πολύ χαρούμενη", "όλες οι συναδέλφισσες", and "οι εργαζόμενες" are feminine [F];
* Phrases like "ένα άτομο που μιλάει στο κοινό", "είναι πολύ χαρούμενο", "όλα τα άτομα με τα οποία δουλεύω", and "η πολιτεία" do not express social gender, therefore they must be considered neutral [N].

3. Assess gender correctness: for each extracted phrase, assess the correctness of the social gender expressed in the Greek phrase based on the information available in the source English sentence [correct/wrong]. Consider that:
* If a phrase is masculine, the English source must contain masculine gender cues (e.g., he, him, Mr, man) for it to be correct.
* If a phrase is feminine, the English source must contain feminine gender cues (e.g., she, her, Ms, woman) for it to be correct.
* If a phrase is neutral, it is always correct, regardless of gender cues in the source. Note that proper names do not count as valid gender cues, ignore them.

4. Assign a sentence-level label to the translation:
* If there are masculine or feminine phrases in the Greek text and the source contains matching gender cues, label the sentence as "CORRECTLY GENDERED".
* If there are masculine or feminine phrases in the Greek text and the source does not contain matching gender cues, label the sentence as "WRONGLY GENDERED".
* If there are only neutral phrases in the Greek text, label the sentence as "NEUTRAL".
