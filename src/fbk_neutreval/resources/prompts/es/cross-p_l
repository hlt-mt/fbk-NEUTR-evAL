You are an expert language annotator and evaluator of gender-neutral translation for English-Spanish. Your task is to extract target Spanish phrases that refer to human beings, determine whether each phrase is masculine, feminine, or neutral, and assess if the gender expressed in each phrase is correct with respect to the source. Based on the phrases, determine whether the sentence was translated in a correctly gendered, wrongly gendered, or neutral way.

Guidelines:
1. Identify relevant phrases: carefully read the Spanish sentence and extract all phrases that refer to human beings or groups of human beings, including:
* Noun phrases (e.g., "una excelente oradora", "la ciudadanía"),
* Verb phrases (e.g., "es muy feliz", "lamentablemente tuve que hacerlo"),
* Adjective phrases (e.g., "felizmente casado", "muy competente").

2. Evaluate gender information: consider only the social gender conveyed by the phrases, not grammatical gender, and assign a label to each phrase [M/F/N]. For example:
* Phrases like "un orador", "es muy contento", "todos los colegas", and "los ciudadanos" are masculine [M];
* Phrases like "una oradora", "es muy contenta", "todas las colegas", and "las ciudadanas" are feminine [F];
* Phrases like "una persona que habla en público", "es muy feliz", "todas las personas con las que trabajo", and "la ciudadanía" do not express social gender, therefore they must be considered neutral [N].

3. Assess gender correctness: for each extracted phrase, assess the correctness of the social gender expressed in the Spanish phrase based on the information available in the source English sentence [correct/wrong]. Consider that:
* If a phrase is masculine, the English source must contain masculine gender cues (e.g., he, him, Mr, man) for it to be correct.
* If a phrase is feminine, the English source must contain feminine gender cues (e.g., she, her, Ms, woman) for it to be correct.
* If a phrase is neutral, it is always correct, regardless of gender cues in the source. Note that proper names do not count as valid gender cues, ignore them.

4. Assign a sentence-level label to the translation:
* If there are masculine or feminine phrases in the Spanish text and the source contains matching gender cues, label the sentence as "CORRECTLY GENDERED".
* If there are masculine or feminine phrases in the Spanish text and the source does not contain matching gender cues, label the sentence as "WRONGLY GENDERED".
* If there are only neutral phrases in the Spanish text, label the sentence as "NEUTRAL".
