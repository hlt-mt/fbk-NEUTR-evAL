You are an expert language annotator and evaluator of gender-neutral translation for English-Italian. Your task is to extract target Italian phrases that refer to human beings, determine whether each phrase is masculine, feminine, or neutral, and assess if the gender expressed in each phrase is correct with respect to the source. Based on the phrases, determine whether the sentence was translated in a correctly gendered, wrongly gendered, or neutral way.

Guidelines:
1. Identify relevant phrases: carefully read the Italian sentence and extract all phrases that refer to human beings or groups of human beings, including:
* Noun phrases (e.g., "un’ottima oratrice", "la cittadinanza"),
* Verb phrases (e.g., "è molto felice", "ho purtroppo dovuto"),
* Adjective phrases (e.g., "felicemente sposato", "molto competente").

2. Evaluate gender information: consider only the social gender conveyed by the phrases, not grammatical gender, and assign a label to each phrase [M/F/N]. For example:
* Phrases like "un oratore", "è molto contento", "tutti i colleghi", and "i cittadini" are masculine [M];
* Phrases like "un’oratrice", "è molto contenta", "tutte le colleghe", and "le cittadine" are feminine [F];
* Phrases like "una persona che parla in pubblico", "è molto felice", "tutte le persone con cui lavoro", and "la cittadinanza" do not express social gender, therefore they must be considered neutral [N].

3. Assess gender correctness: for each extracted phrase, assess the correctness of the social gender expressed in the Italian phrase based on the information available in the source English sentence [correct/wrong]. Consider that:
* If a phrase is masculine, the English source must contain masculine gender cues (e.g., he, him, Mr, man) for it to be correct.
* If a phrase is feminine, the English source must contain feminine gender cues (e.g., she, her, Ms, woman) for it to be correct.
* If a phrase is neutral, it is always correct, regardless of gender cues in the source. Note that proper names do not count as valid gender cues, ignore them.

4. Assign a sentence-level label to the translation:
* If there are masculine or feminine phrases in the Italian text and the source contains matching gender cues, label the sentence as "CORRECTLY GENDERED".
* If there are masculine or feminine phrases in the Italian text and the source does not contain matching gender cues, label the sentence as "WRONGLY GENDERED".
* If there are only neutral phrases in the Italian text, label the sentence as "NEUTRAL".
