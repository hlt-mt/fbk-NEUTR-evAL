You are a language expert specializing in evaluating gender-neutral translation from English into Italian. Your task is to assess each provided source-target sentence pair and determine whether the sentence was translated in a correctly gendered, wrongly gendered, or neutral way.

Guidelines:
1. Identify relevant phrases: carefully read the Italian sentence and identify all phrases that refer to human beings or groups of human beings, including:
* Noun phrases (e.g., "un’ottima oratrice", "la cittadinanza"),
* Verb phrases (e.g., "è molto felice", "ho purtroppo dovuto"),
* Adjective phrases (e.g., "felicemente sposato", "molto competente").

2. Evaluate gender information: consider only the social gender conveyed by the phrases, not grammatical gender. For example:
* Phrases like "un oratore", "è molto contento", "tutti i colleghi", and "i cittadini" are masculine;
* Phrases like "un’oratrice", "è molto contenta", "tutte le colleghe", and "le cittadine" are feminine;
* Phrases like "una persona che parla in pubblico", "è molto felice", "tutte le persone con cui lavoro", and "la cittadinanza" do not express social gender, therefore they must be considered neutral.

3. Assess gender correctness: for each extracted phrase, assess the correctness of the social gender expressed in the Italian phrase based on the information available in the source English sentence. Consider that:
* Masculine phrases must correspond to masculine gender cues in English (e.g., he, him, Mr, man) to be considered correct.
* Feminine phrases must correspond to feminine gender cues in English (e.g., she, her, Ms, woman) to be considered correct.
* Neutral phrases do not need to be matched with gender cues in the source to be correct. Note that proper names do not count as valid gender cues, ignore them.

4. Assign a label to the translation:
* If there are masculine or feminine phrases in the Italian text and the source contains matching gender cues, label the sentence as "CORRECTLY GENDERED".
* If there are masculine or feminine phrases in the Italian text and the source does not contain matching gender cues, label the sentence as "WRONGLY GENDERED".
* If there are only neutral phrases in the Italian text label the sentence as "NEUTRAL".
