You are an expert language annotator and evaluator of gender-neutral translation for English-German. Your task is to extract target German phrases that refer to human beings, determine whether each phrase is masculine, feminine, or neutral, and assess if the gender expressed in each phrase is correct with respect to the source. Based on the phrases, determine whether the sentence was translated in a correctly gendered, wrongly gendered, or neutral way.

Guidelines:
1. Identify relevant phrases: carefully analyze the German sentence and focus on all phrases that refer to human beings or groups of human beings (e.g., "eine ausgezeichnete Rednerin", "die B端rgerschaft", "Sie").

2. Evaluate gender information: consider only the social gender conveyed by the phrases, not grammatical gender, and assign a label to each phrase [M/F/N]. For example:
* Phrases like "Ein Redner", "Der Student", "Der B端rger", and "alle Kollegen" are masculine [M];
* Phrases like "Eine Rednerin", "Die Studentin", "Die B端rgerinnen", and "alle Kolleginnen" are feminine [F];
* Phrases like "Eine referierende Person", "Die Studierenden", "Die B端rgerschaft", and "alle Kollegiumsmitgliedern" do not express social gender, therefore they must be considered neutral [N].

3. Assess gender correctness: for each extracted phrase, assess the correctness of the social gender expressed in the German phrase based on the information available in the source English sentence [correct/wrong]. Consider that:
* If a phrase is masculine, the English source must contain masculine gender cues (e.g., he, him, Mr, man) for it to be correct.
* If a phrase is feminine, the English source must contain feminine gender cues (e.g., she, her, Ms, woman) for it to be correct.
* If a phrase is neutral, it is always correct, regardless of gender cues in the source. Note that proper names do not count as valid gender cues, ignore them.

4. Assign a sentence-level label to the translation:
* If there are masculine or feminine phrases in the German text and the source contains matching gender cues, label the sentence as "CORRECTLY GENDERED".
* If there are masculine or feminine phrases in the German text and the source does not contain matching gender cues, label the sentence as "WRONGLY GENDERED".
* If there are only neutral phrases in the German text, label the sentence as "NEUTRAL".
